## Solution

Let's annotate the assembly code

```asm
void test(long i, b_struct *bp)
i in %rdi, bp in %rsi
0000000000000000 <test>:
 0: 8b 8e 20 01 00 00	mov	0x120(%rsi),%ecx		# fetch bp->last
 6: 030e				add	(%rsi),%ecx				# bp->last + bp->first
 8: 48 8d 04 bf			lea	(%rdi,%rdi,4),%rax		# 5i
 c: 48 8d 04 c6			lea	(%rsi,%rax,8),%rax		# %rax <- bp + 40i
 10: 48 8b 50 08		mov	0x8(%rax),%rdx			# %rdx <- M[bp + 40i + 8]
 14: 48 63 c9			movslq	%ecx,%rcx			# sign-extend %ecx
 17: 48 89 4c d0 10		mov	%rcx,0x10(%rax,%rdx,8)	# M[bp + 40i + 16 + %rdx*8] <- %rcx
 1c: c3					retq
```

- `bp->last` has an offset of 288 $\implies$ `sizeof(int) + padding + sizeof(a_struct) * CNT` is 288.
- `ap` = `bp + 8 + 40i`
- `%rdx` stores `ap->idx`

#### A.

In `b_struct`, `first` comes before the array `a[CNT]`, and as we can see from the way `ap` is gotten,
there is an extra offset of 8 apart from the offset caused by preceding elements in `a`.
These 8 bits include `int first`, and a padding of 4 bytes after that.

From the first point, we see `4 + 4 + 40 * CNT = 288` $\implies$ `CNT = 7`.

#### B.

In the final `mov` instruction, `bp + 40i + 16 + %rdx * 8` can be written as
`ap + 8 + idx * 8`.

We can conclude from this that in `a_struct`, the first 8 bits are occupied by `idx`, and the later
bits are occupied by an array with elements of size `8`, i.e. of type `long`.

Because the size of `a_struct` is 40 (from its array in `b_struct`), $8 + 8 * len(x) = 40$.
We obtain that length of array x is 4.

```c
typedef struct {
	long idx;
	long x[4];
};
```

# 3.61

## Problem

In Section 3.6.6, we examined the following code as a candidate for the use of conditional data transfer:

```c
long cread(long *xp) {
	return (xp ? *xp : 0);
}
```

We showed a trial implementation using a conditional move instruction but argued that it was not valid, since it could attempt to read from a null address.
Write a C function cread_alt that has the same behavior as cread, except that it can be compiled to use conditional data transfer. When compiled, the generated code should use a conditional move instruction rather than one of the jump instructions.

## Solution

Any arguments to `cmov*` instruction will be executed. If we pass a
reference to a null pointer, the deferencing will be attempted even
if the condition is incorrect.

Here we perform a conditional move with
the pointer rather than the value it references.

```c
long cread_alt(long *xp) {
	long *zeroPtr = 0;
	long *resultPtr = xp != NULL ? xp : zeroPtr;
	return *resultPtr;
}
```

## Solution

#### A.

#### B.

`stack pointer + 64`

#### C.

Relative to the stack pointer.

But there is an extra offset of 8 added due to `call`
(occupied by the return address), so an offset of 24 from
`%rsp` would refer to `s.p` from the answer to A, and
`s.a[0]` would be at an offset of 8.

#### D.

By moving elements of s to addresses relative to the argument.

#### E.

#### F.

Structs can be passed as part of the "Argument build" area
on the stack frame of the caller. The argument that is
passed in `%rdi` register was the memory address of where
the return struct should be stored. The space for it was
allocated by the caller before hand. This was also the
address that was returned.

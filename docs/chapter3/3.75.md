## Solution

#### A.

Real part takes up one FP register, imaginary part takes the next.
Consecutive registers are used (extrapolating this, if stored
on the stack as arguments, they should be stored consecutively
in a similar fashion).

#### B.

Real part of return value is stored in `%xmm0`, imaginary part in
`%xmm1`.

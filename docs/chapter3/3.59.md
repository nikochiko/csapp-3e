## Problem

The following code computes the 128-bit product of two 64-bit signed values x and y and stores the result in memory:

```c
1	typedef __int128 int128_t;
2	
3	void store_prod(int128_t *dest, int64_t x, int64_t y) {
4	*dest = x * (int128_t) y;
5	}
```

Gcc generates the following assembly code implementing the computation:

```
1	store_prod:
2	movq	%rdx, %rax
3	cqto	
4	movq	%rsi, %rcx
5	sarq	$63, %rcx
6	imulq	%rax, %rcx
7	imulq	%rsi, %rdx
8	addq	%rdx, %rcx
9	mulq	%rsi
10	addq	%rcx, %rdx
11	movq	%rax, (%rdi)
12	movq	%rdx, 8(%rdi)
13	ret	
```

This code uses three multiplications for the multiprecision arithmetic required to implement 128-bit arithmetic on a 64-bit machine. Describe the algorithm used to compute the product, and annotate the assembly code to show how it realizes your algorithm. Hint: When extending arguments of x and y to 128 bits, they can be rewritten as x = 264 · x<sub>h</sub> + x<sub>l</sub> and y = 264 · y<sub>h</sub> + y<sub<l</sub>, where x<sub>h</sub>, x<sub>l</sub>, y<sub>h</sub>, and y<sub<l</sub> are 64-bit values. Similarly, the 128-bit product can be written as p = 264 · ph + pl, where ph and pl are 64-bit values. Show how the code computes the values of ph and pl in terms of x<sub>h</sub>, x<sub>l</sub>, y<sub>h</sub>, and y<sub<l</sub>.

## Solution

While reading the assembly code, it's important to remember
that the `mulq` instruction computes a 128-bit result stored
in `%rdx:%rax%`. That is, the high 64 bits in `%rdx` and the
low 64 bits in `%rax`.

$$
x = 2^{64} \cdot x_{h} + x_{l},\ y = 2^{64} \cdot y_{h} + y_{l}
$$

$$
x \cdot y = (2^{64} \cdot x_{h} + x_{l}) \cdot (2^{64} \cdot y_{h} + y_{l})
$$

$$
x \cdot y = 2^{128} \cdot x_{h} \cdot y_{h} + 2^{64} \cdot (x_{h} \cdot y_{l} + y_{h} \cdot x_{l}) + x_{l} \cdot y_{l}
$$

We can ignore the term with $2^{128}$ because it cannot
fit in 128 bits, and we'd end up with the remainder.

Since $p$ can also be represented similarly in terms of
$p_{h}$ and $p_{l}$, we get

$$
p = 2^{64} \cdot p_{h} + p_{l}
$$

$$
2^{64} \cdot p_{h} + p_{l} = 2^{64} \cdot (x_{h} \cdot y_{l} + y_{h} \cdot x_{l}) + x_{l} \cdot y_{l}
$$

Besides the coefficient of $2^{64}$ on the right hand side,
$x_{l} \cdot y_{l}$ can also add to the value of $p_{h}$.

So, we get:

$$
p_{h} = x_{h} \cdot y_{l} + y_{h} \cdot x_{l} +
quotient(x_{l} \cdot y_{l},\ 2^{64})
$$

And,

$$
p_{l} = (x_{l} \cdot y_{l}) \bmod 2^{64}
$$

This is reflected in our assembly code, we sign extend both $x$ (to
`%rdx:%rax` with line 2 `cqto`) and $y$ (to `%rcx:%rsi` after
line 5 `sarq`).

We first calculate the value of $p_{h}$ without considering the
factor from $x_{l} \cdot y_{l}$ (after line 8) in `%rcx`.

The `mulq` instruction then sets `%rax` and `%rdx` to the low and
high 64-bits of $x_{l} \cdot y_{l}$ respectively.

We then add `%rcx` to `%rdx` to get $p_{h}$ by adding the missing
factor. `%rax` is already $p_{l}$.

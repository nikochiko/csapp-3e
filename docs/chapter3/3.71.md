# 3.71

## Solution

Handles the following cases:
- When line is longer than buffer
- Line is being read from a file that doesn't end with a newline (stops at EOF)

Doesn't handle:
- When some characters follow a null byte in the input. When a null-byte is encountered
it is treated like end of string.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define BUF_SIZE 10

char getLast(char *word) {
    char last = '\0';
    while (*word != '\0') {
        last = *word;
        word++;
    }

    return last;
}

void good_echo() {
    char buf[BUF_SIZE];

    while (fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin) != NULL) {
        fputs(buf, stdout);

        if (buf[0] != '\0' && buf[BUF_SIZE-1] == '\0' && getLast(buf) == '\n')
            break;
    }
}

int main() {
    good_echo();
}
```

# 3.68

## Solution

Annotating the assembly code:
```asm
	void setVal(str1 *p, str2 *q) p in %rdi, q in %rsi
1	setVal:
2	  movslq	8(%rsi), %rax   # %rax = (long) q.t
3	  addq	32(%rsi), %rax      # %rax += q.u
4	  movq	%rax, 184(%rdi)     # p.y = %rax
5	  ret
```

From the assembly code and C code, we can make the observations that:

1. `q.t` is at an offset of 8 from start of q.
    * $\implies$ length of `str2.array` ($B$) is between 5 and 8
        inclusive due to the padding for `t`.
    * $\implies$ At offset 12, `q.t` ends and `q.s` starts
2. `q.u` is at an offset of 32 from the start of q.
    * $\implies$ `q.s` stretched from offset 12 to between
        25 and 32 inclusive, for the padding to match.
3. `p.y` is at an offset of 184 from the start of `p`.
    * $\implies$ Array `x` occupied somewhere between
        177 and 184 bytes.

Putting all 3 inequalities in mathematical form, we get:

$$
5 <= B <= 8, 13 <= 2 \cdot A <= 20,\ 177 <= 4 \cdot A \cdot B <= 184
$$

$$
7 <= A <= 10\ \text{, dividing 2nd inequality by 2}
$$

Divding 3rd inequality by 4:

$$
45 <= A \cdot B <= 46
$$

Two cases:

**Case 1:** $A \cdot B = 45$

Valid values for (A, B): (9, 5)

**Case 2:** $A \cdot B = 46$

No valid values possible in this case because
$46 = 23 \cdot 2$ and 23 is a prime.

We can conclude that `A = 9` and `B = 5`.
